Dependecy resolution is in early stages, now works "it is slow" like the algo 
itself however, however fast enogh, need to introduce more benchmark tests. 
Anyway the reverse engineering, is not done yet, I haven't implemented the 
"PROVIDES" thing, and the code is not really tested like it should be. Need to 
do more checking on it.
Now it is actually discarding version dependecies, which is a temporary solution
of course.
