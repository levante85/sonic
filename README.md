This is going to become a new linux distribution package manager called sonic.
Basic operations implemented are:

-Install

-Query

-Remove

-Depedency test

-Sync

It's at a really early stage and right now it's only a concept. Comparable to 
pacman version 1.0 or 0.1 ( right now I don't remember the version number )...
Some parts in the lib are supposed to be almost production ready, most of them
are not, some parts are only placeholders, notabily the operation package 
( and the many of packages in the utils subdirectory ). It has only something 
around 120 ~ hours of work.
I like to think of it, as minimal viable testing platform so I can develop the 
actual ideas into it.
It's going to be the base on which the actual package manager will be created.
